1. **What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**

One of the topics I'm interested in is decentralized application (Dapp) development. Through this quarter, we've explored tools and technologies involved in building a Dapp. We also covered on the difference of specifications between blockchains, such as consensus, transaction fees, and transaction speed, etc. I learned the importance of choosing the correct chain for a Dapp. 

2. **Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**

For our Quarter 2 project, we would like to investigate the potential of building a real estate transaction Dapp. It's because property transaction right now often requires an agent, aka. middleman. It's difficult to ensure that this agent is neutral and does not withhold information from buyer or seller. With blockchain, all transaction records would be available to everyone which greatly improve the transparency and credibility. Moreover, smart contracts are programs on blockchain, which can be executed within seconds. Making it much more efficient than real estate agents.

3. **What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**

In the first quarter of our project, our primary focus is on formulating a proposal for our real estate transaction dapp. We planned the goals our dapp will accomplish, identified the issues it addresses, and created a comprehensive plan to guide the execution of our project. Moving into the second quarter, our attention shifts towards the practical implementation of our project. This involves translating our conceptual ideas into tangible code. During this phase, we will actively engaged in developing a prototype and creating a demo to showcase the functionality of our dapp.

4. **What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**

I'm interested in side chains and layer 2 chains. To what I understand, many Dapp developers are deploying their Dapp on side chains instead of the mainnet. I would like to learn more about why they are doing this and this may benefit our project.
